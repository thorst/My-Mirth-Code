Automatic Mirth Backup

https://forums.mirthproject.io/forum/mirth-connect/support/16298-code-template-automatic-mirth-backup#post16298

This is just a backup/alternative download. Currently no intention on branching the code here, but if the main version stops getting updated, then maybe.

How to use:
Place the zip4J library in the custom-lib folder of mirth. (It is needed for zip encryption - further info can be found on the website)
Press the button "Reload Resources" under Settings -> Resources in Mirth Administrator
Import the attached code template
