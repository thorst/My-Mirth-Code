/*
    This code shouldn't be dependent on any code templates.    

    Generally speaking this will save a json file per transaction for all channels. There are two ways you can effect this:
    1. ignoreChannels - If you set shouldIgnoreChannels to true, it will ignore all channels in the list.
    2. includeChannels - If you set shouldIncludeChannels to true, it will ignore all channels NOT in the list.
    
    The intention is that one is set to to true, and the other is set to false.

    After the file is saved, a channel reads the files back in, saves them to a MariaDB database, and also saves the timestamps
    to a lastActivity table. Then an api service will return these timestamps for consumption.
	
    Limitations:
        -If you have a destination set to queue, as is our standard, I will not be able to save the ack or the actual
            sent date and time. Instead I will only be able to save the time it was received. You will have the option
            to include a code template on the response transformer for any destinations where you need the ack or actual
            sent datetime.

    Potential additions:
        -Add filter for channel readers, where I dont save the raw, since that could be found on the sending destination <- more effort than its worth
        -Add option to include destination data, for people who dont use queue and/or dont care about the sent datetime etc <- this is outdated, i do this now
