# My-Mirth-Code
A bunch of code I've written for mirth

My preference is for everything to be in code templates, written with as much js in and out as I can. Meaning, where possible, I accept and return js data types. Even if the java code is short, Ill create a js code template wrapper so its easier and has better visibility to the other devs on staff.
